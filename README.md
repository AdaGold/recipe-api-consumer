***Reflections on API - Muncher***
Focusing was difficult last week, to much noise, to much light in the environment. Probably too many nerves about the upcoming conference and the mock interviews, but I didn't recognize my difficulties early and did not seek out the quieter areas avaialble to us.  

I had trouble integrating the new ideas into my project. I found myself rewatching the panopto videos feeling I had missed something and I fell into the trap of seeing how far my class mates were progressing. I didn't recoginize the need to ask for help earlier to get myself unstuck when I felt blocked.  

I spent too much time trying to fix a class name error and ended up reseting my project to the last working commit after shelling out every class in my program trying to debugg it.   

Nov 5th, I got back on track, and was able to spend three consecutive hours getting the functionality of my project working. I learned that I needed to reset the rails server after each change to my api-wrapper module.   

I learned how to use symbols with json by assigning the calls results to variables.  

Melissa has done an excellent job with her project. I looks very clean and nice, and the pagination is beautiful. She was able to integrate models to help her build it (she's taking them out to finish her product).
